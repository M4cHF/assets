## 🌐 Why use jsDelivr CDN instead of Raw GitHub links?

Using **jsDelivr CDN** provides several important advantages:

### ✔ Much Faster Loading
jsDelivr uses a global content delivery network, ensuring your images load quickly from anywhere.

### ✔ Unlimited Bandwidth (Free)
Raw GitHub links can throttle or fail under heavy traffic. jsDelivr is designed for high availability.

### ✔ Better Caching & Performance
Data is cached across many CDN nodes, reducing latency and improving load speed.

### ✔ Clean, Production-Friendly URLs
Raw GitHub URLs (`raw.githubusercontent.com/...`) are slow, unstable, and not optimized for web usage.

### ✔ Optional Versioning
You can also lock your assets to a specific commit or version if needed.
